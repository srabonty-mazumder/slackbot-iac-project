The architecture diagram illustrates the deployment architecture of the Slack-based chatbot system implemented using AWS serverless services. The design represents a production-style logical architecture, clearly showing the interaction between Slack clients and AWS-managed components. All user interactions originate from Slack and are securely transmitted over HTTPS to Amazon API Gateway, which invokes AWS Lambda functions containing the chatbot logic.

The architecture includes annotated networking and security details such as DNS resolution via Amazon Route 53, TLS-encrypted communication, and secure credential management using AWS Secrets Manager. Persistent conversational state is stored in Amazon DynamoDB, while optional file storage and exports are handled by Amazon S3. Monitoring and logging are provided through Amazon CloudWatch.

This architecture demonstrates a scalable, secure, and cost-efficient serverless deployment suitable for real-world usage, while keeping the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation lightweight and focused on core functionality.

Architecture Description: The solution follows a three-tier architecture, clearly separating use interaction, application logic, and data storage. 


### 1.	The Presentation Tier consists of Slack clients (web, desktop, and mobile), where users interact with the chatbot.
### 2.	The Application Tier contains AWS serverless services that process Slack events, execute business logic, and manage integrations.
### 3.	The Data Tier provides persistent storage for conversational state and file-based artifacts.

### Diagram: Slack Chatbot Solution Architecture Visualization

Architecture Flow Explanation (Based on the Provided Diagram)
1.	A user sends a message or command using a Slack client.
2.	Slack sends the event to the backend via HTTPS using the Slack Events API.
3.	Amazon Route 53 resolves the chatbot domain name to the Amazon API Gateway endpoint.
4.	Amazon API Gateway securely receives the request and forwards it to AWS Lambda.
5.	AWS Lambda:

•	Verifies the Slack request using secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
•	Processes the event and executes chatbot logic
•	Reads or writes session data to Amazon DynamoDB
6.	Execution logs and metrics are sent to Amazon CloudWatch.
7.	If required, files or exports generated by the chatbot are stored in Amazon S3.
8.	The response is sent back to Slack, where it is displayed to the user.

## Estimated Costs 

This chapter estimates the major costs associated with deploying and maintaining the Slack Chatbot System in an AWS cloud environment. The calculations are performed based on AWS pricing in the EU-Ireland region, assuming a small-to-medium production workload with moderate use each day. All values are approximate and intended for educational purposes

Architecture Annotations (DNS, IP, TLS, Ports & Critical Details): 

1.	DNS Details:
•	DNS Service: Amazon Route 53
•	Domain Name: chatbot.example.com
•	Record Type: A (ALIAS)
•	Target: Amazon API Gateway (Regional Endpoint)
•	Purpose: Resolves Slack callback URL to API Gateway
2.	IP Addressing
•	Public IPs: Managed by AWS (API Gateway)
•	Static IPs: Not required
•	VPC / Private IPs: Not used (serverless, no VPC)
•	Slack Source IPs: Public, managed by Slack
3.	Network Protocols & Ports
•	Protocol: HTTPS
•	Port: 443
•	Direction: 
Slack → API Gateway (Inbound)
API Gateway → Slack (Outbound)
       All external communication occurs over HTTPS only.
4.	TLS / Encryption
•	Transport Encryption: TLS 1.2+
•	TLS Termination: Amazon API Gateway
•	Certificate: AWS-managed certificate
•	Internal AWS Traffic: Encrypted using AWS service-level TLS
•	Encryption at Rest:
DynamoDB: AWS KMS (managed)
Secrets Manager: AWS KMS (managed)
5.	Authentication & Request Validation
•	Slack Request Verification:
Slack Signing Secret validation
Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
•	Credential Storage: AWS Secrets Manager
•	Access Control: IAM roles with least-privilege permissions
6.	Application & Integration Details
•	Event Source: Slack Events API
•	Integration Endpoint: Amazon API Gateway
•	Compute Service: AWS Lambda (stateless, event-driven)
•	Database: Amazon DynamoDB (on-demand capacity)
•	Object Storage: Amazon S3 (optional)
•	Monitoring: Amazon CloudWatch logs and metrics
•	Scheduled Events (Optional): Amazon EventBridge
7.	Availability & Scaling
•	Availability: Multi-AZ by default (managed services)
•	Scaling: Automatic (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)
•	Failover: Handled by AWS managed services

This work presents the design and cost estimation of a Slack-based chatbot implemented using AWS serverless services. The solution follows a three-tier architecture, with Slack clients forming the presentation tier, AWS serverless components (API Gateway, Lambda, Route 53, Secrets Manager, and CloudWatch) forming the application tier, and DynamoDB and Amazon S3 forming the data tier. All user interactions originate from Slack and are securely transmitted over HTTPS to AWS, where events are processed in a stateless and event-driven manner 
The architecture emphasizes security, scalability, and cost efficiency by using managed AWS services, TLS-encrypted communication, IAM-based access control, and encrypted storage. A cost analysis based on the EU-Ireland region estimates a monthly cost of approximately USD 34.78, demonstrating that the serverless approach is suitable for small-to-medium production workloads while keeping operational and infrastructure costs low
